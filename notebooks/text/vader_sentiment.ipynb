    "# VADER_SENTIMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This function performs sentiment analysis on text using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon, which is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) is a rule-based model that combines a sentiment lexicon with five heuristics to account for punctuation, capitalization, degree modifiers, conjunctions, and negation. For more details, see the [official VADER documentation](https://vaderSentiment.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses the [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) package, which provides a Python interface to the VADER algorithm. For more information, see the [NLTK documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html#module-nltk.sentiment.vader).\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER is a rule-based model that combines a sentiment lexicon with five heuristics to account for punctuation, capitalization, degree modifiers, conjunctions, and negation. Each word in the input text is matched against the VADER lexicon, which assigns a valence score to known words and emoticons. The model then applies rules to adjust these scores based on context, such as increasing intensity for words in all caps or with exclamation marks, and decreasing intensity for negated phrases. The final sentiment is calculated as a normalized, weighted composite score called the compound score, which ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive). This score is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{compound} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\alpha}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the sum of valence scores and $\\alpha$ is a normalization constant (default $\\alpha = 15$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To use the `VADER_SENTIMENT` function in Excel, enter it as a formula in a cell, specifying your text:\n",
    "\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "=VADER_SENTIMENT(text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arguments\n",
    "| Argument | Type   | Required | Description            | Example |\n",
    "|----------|--------|----------|------------------------|---------|\n",
    "| text     | string | Yes      | The text to analyze.   | \"I absolutely love this product!\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returns\n",
    "| Return Value   | Type  | Description                                                        | Example |\n",
    "|----------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n",
    "| Compound Score | float | A normalized score between -1 (most negative) and +1 (most positive). | 0.9042  |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- Designed for English-language, social-media-style text.\n",
    "- May not accurately capture sarcasm, irony, or domain-specific sentiment.\n",
    "- Not suitable for financial or legal sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- Fast, rule-based sentiment analysis for short texts.\n",
    "- No training required; works out-of-the-box.\n",
    "- Useful for social media, reviews, and general sentiment tasks.\n",
    "\n",

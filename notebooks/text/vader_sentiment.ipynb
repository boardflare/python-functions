    "# VADER_SENTIMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This function performs sentiment analysis on text using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon, which is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To use the `VADER_SENTIMENT` function in Excel, enter it as a formula in a cell, specifying your text:\n",
    "\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "=VADER_SENTIMENT(text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arguments\n",
    "| Argument | Type   | Required | Description                   |\n",
    "|----------|--------|----------|-------------------------------|\n",
    "| text     | string | Yes      | The text to analyze.          |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returns\n",
    "| Return Value   | Type  | Description                                                        |\n",
    "|----------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Compound Score | float | A normalized score between -1 (most negative) and +1 (most positive). |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- Designed for English-language, social-media-style text.\n",
    "- May not accurately capture sarcasm, irony, or domain-specific sentiment.\n",
    "- Not suitable for financial or legal sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- Fast, rule-based sentiment analysis for short texts.\n",
    "- No training required; works out-of-the-box.\n",
    "- Useful for social media, reviews, and general sentiment tasks.\n",
    "\n",

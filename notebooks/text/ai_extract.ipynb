    "# AI_EXTRACT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This function uses an AI model to extract specific types of information from text. It is designed for pulling structured data (like dates, contacts, or key points) from unstructured text content such as emails, reports, or meeting notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To use the `AI_EXTRACT` function in Excel, enter it as a formula in a cell, specifying your text, extract type, and any optional arguments as needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "=AI_EXTRACT(text, extract_type, [temperature], [model], [max_tokens], [api_key], [api_url])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace each parameter with your desired value. The function returns a single-column list of extracted items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "| Parameter      | Type         | Required | Description                                                                                                 |\n",
    "|---------------|--------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| text          | string/range | Yes      | The text or cell reference containing the data to analyze.                                                  |\n",
    "| extract_type  | string       | Yes      | The type of information to extract (e.g., \"emails\", \"dates\", \"key points\").                              |\n",
    "| temperature   | float        | No       | Controls the randomness/creativity of the response (0.0 to 2.0). Lower values are more deterministic.       |\n",
    "| model         | string       | No       | The specific AI model ID to use (must support JSON mode, e.g., 'mistral-small-latest').                     |\n",
    "| max_tokens    | int          | No       | Maximum number of tokens for the generated list content.                                                    |\n",
    "| api_key       | string       | No       | API key for authentication. [Get a free API key from Mistral AI](https://console.mistral.ai/).              |\n",
    "| api_url       | string       | No       | OpenAI-compatible API endpoint URL (e.g., https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions).                      |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Value\n",
    "| Return Value   | Type    | Description                                                                                                   |\n",
    "|---------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Extracted Data| 2D list | A single-column list of extracted items as requested.                                                          |\n",
    "| Error         | string  | Error message if extraction fails or input is invalid.                                                          |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo\n",
    "If either `api_key` or `api_url` is not provided, both will default to Boardflare demo values (`api_url`: https://llm.boardflare.com, `api_key`: your Microsoft login token if available). This only works for users logged in with a Microsoft account and provides limited free demo usage. You may obtain a free api_key for [Mistral AI](https://console.mistral.ai/) with your Microsoft account which offers more generous free usage and supports CORS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- The quality of the extraction depends on the clarity of the extract_type and the text provided.\n",
    "- Large text inputs may exceed model context limits and result in truncated or incomplete results.\n",
    "- The function requires an internet connection to access the AI model.\n",
    "- Model availability and output may vary depending on the provider or API changes.\n",
    "- Sensitive or confidential data should not be sent to external AI services.\n",
    "- `temperature` must be a float between 0 and 2 (inclusive). If not, a ValueError is raised.\n",
    "- If you hit the API rate limit for your provider, a message is returned instead of raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- Automates extraction of structured data from unstructured text directly in Excel.\n",
    "- Saves time and improves consistency in reporting and data entry.\n",
    "- Enables dynamic, context-aware extraction using your own data.\n",
    "- More flexible and powerful than manual or native Excel approaches for information extraction.\n",

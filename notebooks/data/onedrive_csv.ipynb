    "# ONEDRIVE_CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This function retrieves a CSV file from the user's Microsoft OneDrive App Folder using the Microsoft Graph API and a global variable `graphToken` for authentication, which is set if the user is signed in. It returns the CSV contents as a 2D list, suitable for use in Excel.  It can be adapted to also load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame to load very large CSV files from your OneDrive App Folder that would otherwise be too large to open directly in Excel, or if you prefer to not use Power Query or other manual steps to import the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To use the `ONEDRIVE_CSV` function in Excel, enter it as a formula in a cell, specifying the path to your CSV file in the OneDrive App Folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "=ONEDRIVE_CSV(file_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The file_path must be to a file in your OneDrive Boardflare for Python App Folder (e.g., `/Apps/Boardflare Python for Excel/your-file.csv`). The function uses app folder permissions as described in the [Microsoft Graph App Folder documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/onedrive-sharepoint-appfolder) and therefore files outside the app folder (e.g. elsewhere in your OneDrive) will not be accessible.  Note that this app folder is also used to store your functions in OneDrive, so you may see *.ipynb files in there as well.  You are free to add as many folders and files as you like to this app folder, and it will not interfere with the app's functionality.  You must also be logged into your OneDrive using the **Login** button next to the **OneDrive** header on the Functions tab before using this function in order for the app to set the `graphToken` global variable. If you are not logged in, the function will return an error.\n",

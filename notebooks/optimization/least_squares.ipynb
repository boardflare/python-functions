    "# LEAST_SQUARES\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `LEAST_SQUARES` function solves nonlinear least-squares problems using the SciPy optimization library. It fits a user-defined model function to observed data by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. For more details, see the [scipy.optimize.least_squares documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html).  This is useful for curve fitting, parameter estimation, and regression analysis directly in Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The least-squares method seeks to find the parameter vector $\\mathbf{p}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "S(\\mathbf{p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i, \\mathbf{p}))^2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_i$ are observed values, $x_i$ are input values, and $f(x, \\mathbf{p})$ is the model function. SciPy's `least_squares` supports bounds and several algorithms (\"trf\", \"dogbox\", \"lm\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This example function is provided as-is without any representation of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To use the `LEAST_SQUARES` function in Excel, enter it as a formula in a cell, specifying the model, data, and initial parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```excel\n",
    "=LEAST_SQUARES(model, xdata, ydata, p_zero, [bounds_lower], [bounds_upper], [method])\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `model` (string, required): Model function as a string, e.g., \"a * x + b\" or \"a * exp(b * x)\". Use variable `x` and parameter names (e.g., `a`, `b`). Example: \"a * x + b\"\n",
    "- `xdata` (2D list of float, required): 2D list or column of x values. Example: `{1;2;3}`\n",
    "- `ydata` (2D list of float, required): 2D list or column of y values. Example: `{2;4;6}`\n",
    "- `p_zero` (2D list of float, required): 2D list or row of initial parameter guesses. Example: `{1,1}`\n",
    "- `bounds_lower` (2D list of float, optional): Lower bounds for each parameter. Example: `{0,0}`\n",
    "- `bounds_upper` (2D list of float, optional): Upper bounds for each parameter. Example: `{10,10}`\n",
    "- `method` (string, optional): Optimization method (\"trf\", \"dogbox\", \"lm\"). Example: \"trf\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns the fitted parameter values as a single row (2D list of float). If the fit fails, an error message string is returned.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **fun : callable**\n",
    "  Function which computes the vector of residuals, with the signature `fun(x, *args, **kwargs)`, i.e., the minimization proceeds with respect to its first argument. The argument `x` passed to this function is an ndarray of shape (n,) (never a scalar, even for n=1). It must allocate and return a 1-D array_like of shape (m,) or a scalar. If the argument `x` is complex or the function `fun` returns complex residuals, it must be wrapped in a real function of real arguments, as shown at the end of the Examples section.\n",
    "- **x0 : array_like with shape (n,) or float**\n",
    "  Initial guess on independent variables. If float, it will be treated as a 1-D array with one element. When method is ‘trf’, the initial guess might be slightly adjusted to lie sufficiently within the given bounds.\n",
    "- **jac : {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs', callable}, optional**\n",
    "  Method of computing the Jacobian matrix (an m-by-n matrix, where element (i, j) is the partial derivative of f[i] with respect to x[j]). The keywords select a finite difference scheme for numerical estimation. The scheme ‘3-point’ is more accurate, but requires twice as many operations as ‘2-point’ (default). The scheme ‘cs’ uses complex steps, and while potentially the most accurate, it is applicable only when fun correctly handles complex inputs and can be analytically continued to the complex plane. Method ‘lm’ always uses the ‘2-point’ scheme. If callable, it is used as `jac(x, *args, **kwargs)` and should return a good approximation (or the exact value) for the Jacobian as an array_like (np.atleast_2d is applied), a sparse matrix (csr_matrix preferred for performance) or a scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator.\n",
    "- **bounds : 2-tuple of array_like or Bounds, optional**\n",
    "  There are two ways to specify bounds:\n",
    "  1. Instance of Bounds class\n",
    "  2. Lower and upper bounds on independent variables. Defaults to no bounds. Each array must match the size of x0 or be a scalar, in the latter case a bound will be the same for all variables. Use np.inf with an appropriate sign to disable bounds on all or some variables.\n",
    "- **method : {'trf', 'dogbox', 'lm'}, optional**\n",
    "  Algorithm to perform minimization.\n",
    "  - ‘trf’ : Trust Region Reflective algorithm, particularly suitable for large sparse problems with bounds. Generally robust method.\n",
    "  - ‘dogbox’ : dogleg algorithm with rectangular trust regions, typical use case is small problems with bounds. Not recommended for problems with rank-deficient Jacobian.\n",
    "  - ‘lm’ : Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in MINPACK. Doesn’t handle bounds and sparse Jacobians. Usually the most efficient method for small unconstrained problems.\n",
    "  Default is ‘trf’. See Notes for more information.\n",
    "- **ftol : float or None, optional**\n",
    "  Tolerance for termination by the change of the cost function. Default is 1e-8. The optimization process is stopped when dF < ftol * F, and there was an adequate agreement between a local quadratic model and the true model in the last step. If None and ‘method’ is not ‘lm’, the termination by this condition is disabled. If ‘method’ is ‘lm’, this tolerance must be higher than machine epsilon.\n",

    "  Characteristic scale of each variable. Setting x_scale is equivalent to reformulating the problem in scaled variables xs = x / x_scale. An alternative view is that the size of a trust region along jth dimension is proportional to x_scale[j]. Improved convergence may be achieved by setting x_scale such that a step of a given size along any of the scaled variables has a similar effect on the cost function. If set to ‘jac’, the scale is iteratively updated using the inverse norms of the columns of the Jacobian matrix (as described in [JJMore]).\n",

    "- **diff_step : None or array_like, optional**\n",
    "  Determines the relative step size for the finite difference approximation of the Jacobian. The actual step is computed as x * diff_step. If None (default), then diff_step is taken to be a conventional “optimal” power of machine epsilon for the finite difference scheme used [NR].\n",

    "  Method for solving trust-region subproblems, relevant only for ‘trf’ and ‘dogbox’ methods.\n",

    "  - 'lsmr' is suitable for problems with sparse and large Jacobian matrices. It uses the iterative procedure scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr for finding a solution of a linear least-squares problem and only requires matrix-vector product evaluations.\n",

    "- **jac_sparsity : {None, array_like, sparse matrix}, optional**\n",
    "  Defines the sparsity structure of the Jacobian matrix for finite difference estimation, its shape must be (m, n). If the Jacobian has only few non-zero elements in each row, providing the sparsity structure will greatly speed up the computations [Curtis]. A zero entry means that a corresponding element in the Jacobian is identically zero. If provided, forces the use of ‘lsmr’ trust-region solver.

    "## Notes\n",
    "- Method ‘lm’ (Levenberg-Marquardt) calls a wrapper over least-squares algorithms implemented in MINPACK (lmder, lmdif). It runs the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm formulated as a trust-region type algorithm. The implementation is based on paper [JJMore], it is very robust and efficient with a lot of smart tricks. It should be your first choice for unconstrained problems. Note that it doesn’t support bounds. Also, it doesn’t work when m < n.\n",
    "- Method ‘trf’ (Trust Region Reflective) is motivated by the process of solving a system of equations, which constitute the first-order optimality condition for a bound-constrained minimization problem as formulated in [STIR]. The algorithm iteratively solves trust-region subproblems augmented by a special diagonal quadratic term and with trust-region shape determined by the distance from the bounds and the direction of the gradient. This enhancements help to avoid making steps directly into bounds and efficiently explore the whole space of variables. To further improve convergence, the algorithm considers search directions reflected from the bounds. To obey theoretical requirements, the algorithm keeps iterates strictly feasible. With dense Jacobians trust-region subproblems are solved by an exact method very similar to the one described in [JJMore] (and implemented in MINPACK). The difference from the MINPACK implementation is that a singular value decomposition of a Jacobian matrix is done once per iteration, instead of a QR decomposition and series of Givens rotation eliminations. For large sparse Jacobians a 2-D subspace approach of solving trust-region subproblems is used [STIR], [Byrd]. The subspace is spanned by a scaled gradient and an approximate Gauss-Newton solution delivered by scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr. When no constraints are imposed the algorithm is very similar to MINPACK and has generally comparable performance. The algorithm works quite robust in unbounded and bounded problems, thus it is chosen as a default algorithm.\n",
    "- Method ‘dogbox’ operates in a trust-region framework, but considers rectangular trust regions as opposed to conventional ellipsoids [Voglis]. The intersection of a current trust region and initial bounds is again rectangular, so on each iteration a quadratic minimization problem subject to bound constraints is solved approximately by Powell’s dogleg method [NumOpt]. The required Gauss-Newton step can be computed exactly for dense Jacobians or approximately by scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr for large sparse Jacobians. The algorithm is likely to exhibit slow convergence when the rank of Jacobian is less than the number of variables. The algorithm often outperforms ‘trf’ in bounded problems with a small number of variables.\n",
    "- Robust loss functions are implemented as described in [BA]. The idea is to modify a residual vector and a Jacobian matrix on each iteration such that computed gradient and Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation match the true gradient and Hessian approximation of the cost function. Then the algorithm proceeds in a normal way, i.e., robust loss functions are implemented as a simple wrapper over standard least-squares algorithms.\n",

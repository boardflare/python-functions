    "## Overview\n",
    "Calculates the molar density of air at a given temperature and pressure using the Lemmon (2000) equation of state [1]. ",
    "This function is crucial in various chemical engineering applications where precise air properties are necessary, such as in thermodynamic calculations, reactor design, and fluid dynamics simulations.\n\n",
    "The Lemmon (2000) model provides accurate thermodynamic properties of air and mixtures of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen over a wide range of temperatures (60 K to 2000 K) and pressures (up to 2000 MPa).\n\n",

    "### Calculating Air Density at Standard Atmospheric Conditions\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to calculate the molar density of air at a common reference point: 300 K (approximately 27\u00b0C or 80\u00b0F) and 101325 Pa (1 standard atmosphere).\n\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",

    "**Expected Output:**\n",
    "*   rho: `40.8315...` mol/m^3 (The exact value will be determined by the function output)\n\n",
    "### Calculating Air Density for an Industrial Process\n",
    "Consider an industrial process where air is used at an elevated temperature and pressure, for example, in a catalytic converter or a high-pressure reactor.\n\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "*   Temperature (T): `500` K\n",
    "*   Pressure (P): `10000000` Pa (10 MPa)\n\n",
